Tool to manage karaoke files

Current functionality:
* Run replaygain analysis on all of your mp3+g zip files
* Mass unzip audio+g zip files
* Mass zip audio+g files to create audio+g zip files
* Convert audio+g zip files that were compressed using DEFLATE64 to standard zips using DEFLATE to fix compatibility with OpenKJ and other hosting software

Note: This is very much experimental at the moment. Do not use it on your karaoke files if you don't have a backup.
